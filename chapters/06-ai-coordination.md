## 6.1 Observability & Feedback
- Telemetry for structure/action/mediation (pod mix; commit/PRs; retrospectives)
- Dashboards map Wolf↑ / Turtle↓ / Bear↓ → recommend rebalancing

## 6.2 Policy Shaping & Dynamic Incentives
- Contextual bandits/RL to adjust bounty weights, review queues, meeting cadence
- Explainability: “Raised mediation weight due to conflict frequency + latency to resolution”

## 6.3 Safety, Equity, and Explainability
- Guardrails against mode collapse (over-optimizing shipping at culture’s expense)
- Fairness: ensure access, rotate leadership, publish allocation policies
