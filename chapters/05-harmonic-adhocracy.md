## 5.1 Turtle–Wolf–Bear Roles
- 🐢 **Turtle → State/Reader:** structure, archives, audits  
- 🐺 **Wolf → IO/Async:** experiments, sprints, delivery  
- 🐻 **Bear → Either/Validation/Writer:** mediation, reflection, narrative

## 5.2 Rituals as `return`; Councils as `bind`
- Ritual opening = **return gratitude** (stabilizes environment)
- Council = **bind deliberation** (composes contributions)
- Clan Mothers = **effect handlers** (appoint/depose, adjust policy)
