# 2. Background & Related Work

**Purpose:** situate MCT within computing, governance, and organizational design.

## 2.1 Programs as Processes (SICP)
- Computation as **structure + interpretation**: primitives, combination, abstraction, evaluators.
- Metalinguistic abstraction → path to Free monads and effect handlers.

## 2.2 Monads & Effects
- From Moggi/Wadler to modern effect systems: Maybe/Either, Reader/State/Writer, IO/Resource, STM, transformers, algebraic effects.
- Monadic laws align with reasoning under composition.

## 2.3 Ritual Governance & Matrilineal Law
- Haudenosaunee (Kanienʼkehá꞉ka): matrilineal lineage, Clan Mothers, consensus.
- Thanksgiving Address as **return**—shared value injection that stabilizes evaluation.

## 2.4 The I Ching as a Calculus of Change
- Hexagrams as situational evaluators; temporal interpreter for valid transformations.
- Mirrors effectful sequencing and policy flips.

## 2.5 Adhocracy & Modern Teaming
- Autonomy, pods, rotating leadership.  
- Harmonic Adhocracy adds archetypal balance: **Turtle** (structure), **Wolf** (action), **Bear** (mediation).
