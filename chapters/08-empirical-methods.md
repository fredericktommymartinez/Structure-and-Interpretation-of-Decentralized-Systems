# 8. Empirical Methods & Evaluation

## 8.1 Structural Metrics
- Bind density (% flows with lawful composition)  
- Law adherence (property-based tests)  
- Invariant survival across refactors/releases

## 8.2 Performance & Sociotechnical Outcomes
- MTTR for coordination bugs; change failure rate at effect boundaries  
- Throughput (PRs/week, cycle time)  
- Cultural health (time-to-resolution, conflict frequency, onboarding satisfaction)

## 8.3 Emergence Studies
- Blind tasks (no FP framing): measure convergence to bind-like structures and short-circuiting  
- Compare quality and change resilience

## 8.4 Threats to Validity
- Selection/survivor bias; language ergonomics confounds; Hawthorne effects  
- Mitigations: multi-org sampling, cross-language replications, pre-registered analyses
