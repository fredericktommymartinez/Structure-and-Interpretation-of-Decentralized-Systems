# 11. Conclusion & Future Work

**Conclusion.** Across codebases and councils, the same algebra shapes coherent decentralization. **Monadic Coordination Theory** explains why: if a system must compose under uncertainty while preserving invariants, it adopts monadic form—whether as `bind` in code, as ritual in culture, or as role triads in teams.

## Future Work
- Formal proof sketches of the inevitability claim over broader categories (e.g., enriched, temporal).  
- Reference social effect system with open-source dashboards and interpreters.  
- Longitudinal field studies across DAOs and product teams.  
- Cross-cultural co-design of **rituals-as-interfaces**.
