## Abstract

This dissertation proposes a unifying, compositional account of how complex technical and social systems coordinate activity coherently without centralized control. I develop **Monadic Coordination Theory (MCT)**: a four-layer model—**Atomic, Domain, Control, Orchestration**—that explains why monadic structures recur in reliable software, resilient organizations, and living governance traditions. I show that the same algebraic constraints that yield monads in programming also appear as rituals, roles, and rules in human institutions (e.g., Haudenosaunee matrilineal governance, I Ching change logic), and as design grammars in modern product teams (e.g., Harmonic Adhocracy: Turtle–Wolf–Bear archetypes).

The dissertation integrates: (1) formal foundations from category theory, interpreters (SICP), and effect systems; (2) a social operating model (**Harmonic Adhocracy**) with an AI coordination layer; (3) empirical methodology for detecting compositional patterns; and (4) case studies spanning **Bitcoin University (BTCU)**, the **Stacks AI Guild**, a **Street Fighter combat logic OS**, and **tokenized travel**. The claim is strong: under compositional constraints (associativity, identity, invariant preservation), monadic coordination is structurally inevitable across code and culture. I provide practical artifacts—DSLs, pseudocode, visualizations—and an evaluation plan linking structure to outcomes (reliability, time-to-change, defect density, conflict resolution). The result is both a theory and a toolkit for building decentralized systems that are coherent, adaptive, and humane.
